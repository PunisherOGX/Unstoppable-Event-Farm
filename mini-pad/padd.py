"""
MUT pad daemon — runs on the Mac mini inside the GUI (Aqua) session.

Owns the two things that only work from inside a logged-in GUI session:
  - controller input via Quartz.CGEventPost(kCGHIDEventTap, ...)
  - screen capture via /usr/sbin/screencapture

Listens on 127.0.0.1 only. Reached from the MacBook over SSH, e.g.
    ssh mini 'curl -s -H "X-Pad-Token: $(cat ~/mut-pad/token)" \
        -X POST 127.0.0.1:8773/press -d "{\"buttons\":[\"right\",\"cross\"]}"'

Why this exists: CGEventPost injects at the HID layer, which is machine-global.
Running it on the MacBook takes over the player's mouse and keyboard. Running it
here does not, because nobody is sitting at the mini.
