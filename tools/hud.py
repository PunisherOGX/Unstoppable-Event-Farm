"""Read the live HUD by CONTENT, not by fixed coordinates.

⛔⛔ WHY THIS EXISTS. MADDEN USES MORE THAN ONE SCOREBOARD LAYOUT, and they
put the same values in different places:

    game 1   wide bar across the bottom; clock at x~1180-1530; both scores
             left of it, cycling with stat pop-ups
    game 2   compact CENTRED block; clock at x~860-1055; one score each side,
             and the down-and-distance on a SECOND ROW above the clock

A fixed crop cut for the first layout is pinned to it, so in
the second one CLOCKS sampled BARE GRASS. The farm lost the game clock, the play
clock, the quarter and the score at once: 7 of 7 snaps fell through to "clock
unreadable", silently disabling clock chewing, quarter tracking and the Q4
bail-out. Nothing raised its hand, because every one of those failures is a
legal "not readable right now".

⛔ A crop set per layout is NOT the fix - Madden ships several broadcast
packages and we cannot enumerate them. Find values by WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE and
where they sit RELATIVE TO EACH OTHER, and the layout stops mattering.

⭐ TWO THINGS THIS FILE GETS RIGHT THAT A FLAT TOKEN LIST CANNOT:

  * ROWS. The centred block stacks "1ST & GOAL" ABOVE "2ND 1:17 :34", and their
    x-ranges OVERLAP. Sorting tokens by x alone interleaves the two rows and
    makes the down look like it follows the quarter. Group by y first.

  * MULTI-SCALE VOTING. Measured on one frame: the wide crop found the
    opponent's score and read OURS as "U"; the tight crop found ours and lost
    the opponent's. The failures are NOT correlated, which is exactly why the
    archive votes across upscales instead of trusting one.
