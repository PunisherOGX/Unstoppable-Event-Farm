"""LOOK AT THE SCREEN. The tool that makes that the cheap option.

⭐ THE ONE HABIT THAT MATTERS MOST on this project: capture a frame and read it,
never reason about what the code probably does. Nearly every long debugging
session here came from describing behaviour instead of looking, and each was
then solved in seconds by looking. This exists so "just look" is one command.

Usage (from new-event/tools, with the stream up):

    ./calibrate.py shot            full-screen capture -> a PNG you can open
    ./calibrate.py text            full-screen OCR, printed
    ./calibrate.py regions         every configured crop: PNG + what it reads
    ./calibrate.py tabs            live tab-strip read, repeated
    ./calibrate.py clocks          live quarter / game clock / play clock
    ./calibrate.py score           live score read, both boxes
    ./calibrate.py badge           the ARCADE / COMP live-play badge
    ./calibrate.py event           the events list, for EVENT_MATCH
    ./calibrate.py entry           the ENTRY OPTIONS screen + focus analysis
    ./calibrate.py verify          sign the crops off; writes the stamp
                                   grind.py refuses to run without

    ./calibrate.py tempo           ⚠️ PRESSES R3 - opens COACH ADJUSTMENTS
    ./calibrate.py snapfloor N     ⚠️ PRESSES CROSS - tests MIN_SNAP_WAIT

⛔ The two marked commands send input. Everything else is READ-ONLY and is safe
to run while Montrell has the pad.
