"""Everything that READS the screen. No button ever gets pressed from here.

⭐ THE HABIT THIS FILE SERVES: look at the screen, do not reason about what the
code probably does. Every long debugging session on this project came from
describing behaviour instead of capturing a frame - and each was then solved in
seconds by looking. Reading is cheap; keep it that way and use it constantly.

⛔ NEVER shell out to `screencapture`. It costs ~1.9s per call - fixed overhead,
not pixel work - and it returns frames that are SECONDS OUT OF DATE. The pad
daemon captures in-process via CoreGraphics in ~0.03s. That one change took
games from 32 minutes to 17.
